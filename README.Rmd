## Outline

This is an R package to allow the easy use of the University of Exeter colour palettes in **base** plotting and **ggplot2**.

The colour palettes shown are taken from the University of Exeter 2022 [branding](https://brand.exeter.ac.uk/colour/).

## Issues, Bugs, and Suggestions

Issues, bugs, and suggestions can be added to the Issues tab of this repository or please email Daniel Padfield at [d.padfield\@exeter.ac.uk](mailto:d.padfield@exeter.ac.uk){.email}.

## Installation

This package can be installed using `remotes::install_github('padpadpadpad/BrewerUoE')`.

## Usage

All the colours are stored and can be accessed using **uoe_colours()**. We can get the hex codes out very easily.

```{r}
# load package
library(BrewerUoE)

# we can look what names are available for the colours
names(uoe_colours())

# access all the colours
uoe_colours()

# we can access only specific colours
uoe_colours(c('Exeter Dark Green', 'Exeter Deep Green', 'Exeter Highlight Green'))

```
